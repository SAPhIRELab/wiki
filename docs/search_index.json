[["index.html", "Wiki @ SAPhIRE Lab 1 Welcome to the Group Wiki 👋 1.1 Meetings &amp; Reports 1.2 Scheduling Meetings 1.3 Policies for Vacation", " Wiki @ SAPhIRE Lab 1 Welcome to the Group Wiki 👋 This wiki is made public in the hope that it may be useful to others, but it is primarily intended as a guideline for members of our research group. On this page, I provide a high-level overview for new students, outlining what to expect and how to get started. Other pages go into more depth on specific topics that you will encounter at different stages of your time in the group. In the rest of the chapters, we describe the core practices and standards we follow in our research group: Identifying Problems and Conducting Research Code Structure Writing Systems Security Papers Preparing Rebuttals ArXiv Submission Policies Preparing Slides for Presentations Note for New Members: This may seem overwhelming at first—but do not worry. You do not need to absorb everything at once. These resources are meant to support you over time, and you will naturally become familiar with them as you progress. 1.1 Meetings &amp; Reports Weekly Meeting Reports: These reports keep me and your peers informed about your work. - Share what you’ve been working on, roadblocks that you need help with, and what’s next. No need to report everything (e.g., TA duties). This is not about proving productivity. Keep it brief, clear, and focused on interesting updates. You may receive useful feedback from others. Weekly One-on-One Meetings [Duration: 30 minutes]: The goal is to get feedback. Come prepared. We will walk through your weekly meeting report so make sure it is filled atleast a day before the meeting: Briefly summarize what you worked on and key challenges. Focus the discussion on items where you want feedback. When discussing challenges, bring possible options or approaches. Any topic is welcome—technical or personal. Weekly Group Meetings [Duration: 60 minutes]: Typically feature a paper presentation (your own or one you’ve read). Announce ahead of time in the team channel. Go over the paper you wan to present and highlight their limitations, and future work that you can think of. Spend a few hours on the day before to prepare a short presentation using the template covering the following slides: (a) Introduction/Background; (b) Problem Statement, (c) Experimental Setup; (d) Results and Analysis; and (e) Limitations and Future Work that you can work on as new projects. See the section on how to make presentations. The goal here is to get you learn how to make presentations and practice giving talks. For me and others, this will give us a chance to identify interesting extensions to work on as projects. Weekly Project Meetings [Duration: 60 minutes]: Each project has a weekly meeting with its members to discuss progress and updates, roadblocks and how to address them, and how to position the work. Brainstorming Sessions [Duration: TBD as needed]: Held as needed to: - Review papers and identify research problems to work on. Build research themes (e.g., for grants or theses). Expose you to the grant-writing and ideation process. Involve one or more students who may later work on resulting projects. Once ideas are finalized, new projects will be added to the research project list. 1.2 Scheduling Meetings To schedule meetings: Check my calendar Select an available time slot. Start all meetings after 10:30 am. Bookmark the calendar link—you will need it regularly to schedule meetings. 1.3 Policies for Vacation I encourage students to take time off to recharge and can help return to problems with a fresh perspective. If you plan to take a vacation, please ensure the following: Confirm there are no critical deadlines during this period (e.g., submissions, rebuttals). Planning ahead ensures minimal disruption, inform Vasisht and obtain approval. Notify your collaborators and ensure your absence does not disrupt shared projects. Cancel all one-on-one meetings with Vasisht for the duration. Coordinate with project collaborators to decide whether project meetings should also be paused. "],["guidelines-research-projects.html", "2 Guidelines: Research Projects 2.1 List of Research Projects 2.2 Types of Projects 2.3 My Approach to Identifying Research Problems 2.4 Careful with Terminology 2.5 How to Approach Projects", " 2 Guidelines: Research Projects Undergraduates: Undergraduates can select a project to worn on with master’s or PhD students, typically helping with implementation and experimentation. The goal is to provide early exposure to research and prepare you for potential graduate studies. Master’s Students: Master’s students are usually paired with a PhD student on an existing project to learn: how projects evolve, and our group’s working style. You may also propose your own project, provided it meets the criteria for a good research project (note: a “good project” is not the same as a top-tier paper). Independent projects are allowed if you are confident about completing them successfully. Run your ideas by Vasisht (and get feedback from other members of the group) before continuing with the project. Expectations for PhD Students: PhD students are expected to lead around three to four projects during their PhD and serve as first author on these projects. You may collaborate with master’s or undergraduate students, but your contributions must be clearly distinguishable and substantial (covering implementation; writing and leadership). Mentorship by Senior PhD Students (4th year): Senior PhD students are expected to mentor junior students by (a) proposing ideas suitable for undergraduate or master’s theses, and (b) guiding project execution, experimental rigor, and implementation quality. It is encouraged to have two or so non–first-authored papers where you acted as a mentor and project lead. Such projects may also be included in your thesis, especially if you proposed the idea. You claim mentorship experience of junior students this way. Project Load: For each master’s and Ph.D. students should typically work on around two projects at a time. This allows you to continue making progress if one project temporarily hits a roadblock. Collaboration and Teamwork: Since our work is heavily empirical, I strongly encourage students to work in pairs. This helps with: (a) learning from each other, (b) catching bugs through cross-checking, (c) brainstorming when stuck, (d) reducing individual overhead, and (e) managing empirically heavy workloads. However, tasks must be clearly differentiated. This is essential for statements of contribution in theses, and dair and transparent credit allocation. Be explicit and upfront about who is responsible for what. Authorship Guidelines: First Author: Leads the project, does most of the implementation and writing, and may have proposed or refined the idea. Second Author: Contributes significant implementation and writing, supporting the first author. Subsequent Authors: Provide high-level supervision and guidance (e.g., faculty, postdocs). Equal authorship is acceptable, but the division of work must be clearly documented, especially for thesis reporting. 2.1 List of Research Projects A list of potential research projects is maintained in an internal Google document. This document is confidential and must not be shared externally. Respect intellectual property, and work with the original proposers and give appropriate credit. If interested in a topic, contact the listed mentor (me and/or the students who proposed an idea mentioned in the document). Proposing New Ideas: Before adding a new idea, discuss it with me and others in the lab to identify gaps and refine it. This process is intentionally adversarial (acting as devil’s advocate to try and identify gaps) to filter weak ideas and identify promising ones. Once project seems reasonable, add it to the project list to gauge interest from other members of the group. If multiple students are interested: you may lead the project and assign tasks, and/or act as a mentor and let junior students execute the work (assuming it is not o primary interest to you). I also recommend maintaining a personal idea list and revisiting it periodically. 2.2 Types of Projects This is inherently hard—there is no fixed formula for a good paper. I particularly enjoy projects that offer a clear and compelling takeaway. These include work that challenges widely accepted assumptions, highlights fundamental limitations of existing approaches, or proposes new, principled directions or guidelines for a research area. I also value projects that are experimentally rigorous, providing comprehensive evaluations that cover all relevant baselines and corner cases. Answering “why” does some unintended behavior happens is harder but more rewarding compared to “how” to do something (e.g., showing attacks work). Always strive to include a discussion on why along with how to strenghten the paper regalrdless of type pf project indicated below. Libraries and Benchmarks: Designing open-source libraries or frameworks for real-world use and industry adoption is valuable. However, it requires significant time and maintenance effort, and adoption by researchers or practitioners is uncertain and difficult to predict. Pursue this path only with clear motivation and long-term commitment. Attack Papers: Attack papers can be attractive but come with important caveats: many are low-hanging fruit, leading to high competition and high risk of being scooped. Simply adapting existing attacks to new model classes or threat types is usually weak unless the attack is non-trivial, substantially outperforms prior work, and breaks existing defenses in a meaningful way. Personally, papers that show “known attack X works can be adapted to new model type Y” are not very exciting even if they can be published in top-tier venues (with extensive empirical evaluation) 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. I would identify such papers as low hanging fruits which are ok as projects for master’s students but I suggest Ph.D students to take up more interesting research directions. As an exception to the above discussion, works that proposes a new, practical threat models and presents the first attack in a practical setting or real-world systems can be very interesting (see papers by Vitaly Shmatikov as an example); or highlighting issues and provide insights with exisiting work 1. Similarly, papers that systematically break prior defenses and expose systematic limitations in prior work (e.g., Carlini-style work: 1, 2, 3, 4) are good contributions, as they highlight systematic issues with approaches in the community and provide guidelines to address them. Defense Papers: Designing strong defenses is extremely difficult.Despite empirical evaluation showing that a defense is effective, it is important to check whether the protection is due to the defense design or an artifact of improper attack setup: 1 and 2. It is very important to design strong attacks in order to demonstrate effectiveness of defenses. This includes that the hyperparameter tuning for the attacks to improve attack effectiveness. This is the reason several papers on robustness have been broken1, 2, 3, 4). When proposing a defense: assume a fully informed adversary, and consider all realistic attack strategies, including assuming that the adversary can design attacks specific to the defense (aka “adaptive attack” though that use is incorrect). Also, important to stress-test the defense thoroughly against all attacks tuned to ensure perfect attack success. Additionally, it is acceptable for a defense to be imperfect where the you clearly state when it works and when it fails, you justify why the effective regime matters, and discuss limitations and future directions to address the limitations transparently. For instance, see the paper on fingerprinting using conferrable examples which is not effective with adversarial training 1. Systems Papers: Laminator and Pal*M SoK (Systematization of Knowledge): An SoK paper is not merely a survey, and doing it well is challenging—often harder than writing a standard attack or defense paper. While simple categorization (e.g., 1) can be useful and accepted at top venues, such works are closer to conventional surveys and are not what I aim to do. I view a strong SoK as proposing a guideline, framework, or theory that explains how and why phenomena occur. This theory is necessarily a conjecture—imperfect but principled—that captures the majority of cases through underlying factors or principles, and enables reasoning about and prediction of future cases. The evaluation in an SoK should therefore justify why the conjecture is reasonable: by showing that it explains prior work and by empirically validating unexplored cases. In other words, prior work should be used to validate your proposed theory or conjecture. Strong SoK papers articulate a unifying framework or conjecture and support it through systematic analysis and/or empirical evidence. Throughout, they should clearly identify who can use the framework, how it should be applied, and why it is useful. See 1 and 2. Proposing a Novel Notion/Concept: Sometimes the paper is not necessarily ground breaking but introduces a new concept. For instance, my first work on “Attesting Distributional Properties of Training Data” is not a practical solution that is likely to be deployed. Hence, I downplay that work in presentations. But I use this to highlight limitations of such techniques such as those based and also the first paper to propose the notion of ML property attestation. Similarly, there could be papers which you are proposing for the first time but do not have good solutions to solve it. I encourage you to write it up with tentative solutions or directions, and highlight the limitations and need for future work to address them. These can also be reframed as a position paper is sufficient positions are identified and defended. Position Papers: I have also dabbled with position papers when the community seemed to have deviated from some core principles. This can be good pieces of work. But generally, you should have expertise on some topic to identify that something is completely wrong and you can rant about it in a systematic and principled way (see 1, 2). Hence, their occurances will be rather rare and will be explored only if there is substantial thing to say clearly highlighting the issues and presenting guidelines to address them, which cannot be covered in a tweet or a blogpost. 2.3 My Approach to Identifying Research Problems I highlight my general approach to identify research problems. Note that this is not perfect and many times I get excited about some ideas but have to be discarded over more discussions and thinking as they are incremental and not very exciting as initially thought. I suggest have a scratchpad of ideas and spend time on verifying if they are reasonable by talking with others including me. Note that a lot of my ideas get discarded so don’t get discouraged by it. The first step to identify new ideas is to read papers. There is not alternative to this. The more variety papers you read, the more ideas you get. for a specifi topic or if you want to break into a new topic, identify most important papers (recent SOTA papers from top tier venues), published SoKs, and track down other related works using the papers cited within them. Once you start going over them, you can see whether your idea holds with respect all those papers. Naive Combinations: Having read some papers on different problems, I try to see whether either their approaches can be used to solve problems in ML Security and privacy. This gave give an initial low hanging fruit ideas to explore after which additional discussions are required to show the challenges in using the concepts directly. More challenges make a good paper once you solve them and shows that your work is not a trivial extension of prior work. Inspired from Other Domains: Papers inspired by topics already explored in other areas is often interesting to me. For instance, works which make parallels between systems security problems of data and control flow integrity with prompt injection attacks are the right way to this of this. Hence, working on papers which take inspiration from concepts in other fields (e.g., return oriented programming) and motivate their approach by describing parallels with other techniques can be interesting way to frame research problems. Additionally, this can be across different domains: I often think about how problems in security and privacy can benefit from research in other fields such as programming languages, formal verification, human-computer interaction, etc. to explore what tools and techniques in other fields can address problems in the current field of research (ML security and privacy). Systematic Work: Even when prior work addresses a problem, it is often in isolation and limited to specific attacks or defenses. I am drawn to systematic research that comprehensively surveys related work, identifies recurring patterns and failure modes, and develops principled, general solutions that extend beyond the specific cases previously studied. Although this approach requires more effort, it yields a unified explanation of broad classes of phenomena rather than fragmented insights across many narrow papers. I prefer one strong, comprehensive paper built on a common underlying framework compared to multiple shorter papers that each study a single case or specific instantiation of the general problem. For example, while several works examine pairwise defense combinations or unintended interactions, my work systematically synthesizes prior results, exposes their limitations, and provides a unified explanation applicable across settings (see 1 and 2). Crucially, such frameworks answer the underlying “why”, enabling explanation and prediction of new interactions; subsequent case studies then primarily serve to empirically validate these predictions and are not suprising since they can be explained using your framework. In my experience, this style of work leads to deeper, more impactful contributions. Identify Problems Pertaining to Practical Deployment: People often complain that research is not applicable for practical systems. And indeed a lot of papers being published consider academic problems (for instance, personally various privacy attacks such as distribution inference and membership inference seem of academic interests but not necessarily a concern for practitioners). Any opportunity you get, try to have conversations with people in the industry to see what problems they think are an issues For all papers, try to identify a set of requirements which should be ideally met by the attacks, defenses, or other systems you are working on and show how the design meets all requirements but also evaluate against each of those requirements. See discussion on examples of different possible requirements in the chapter presenting guidelines on writing papers. 2.4 Careful with Terminology ML literature is riddled with bad terminology and please avoid them while writing papers: “Adaptive attacks”: ML community uses adaptive attacks to indicate a setting where adversary knows about the defenses and designs attacks against them. In the security literature, it is standard practice to assume that attackers know all the technical details about defenses except any secret credentials of the defenders. We will use “adaptive” in the traditional systems security sense where adversary optimizes query based on loss of previous responses. Hence, we have the following convention: na\"ive (no knowledge of defense), non-adaptive (optimizes attacks on another local surrogate model without feedback from target model), and adaptive (optimizes attack using feedback from the previous target model responses). Some evasion attacks and jailbreaks can be considered adaptive if they optimize their queries based on previous responses from target model. An implication of this incorrect use of terminology has resulted in publication of three set of papers: (i) first paper highlights a problem and proposes a “defense” assuming a simple adversary (aka naive adversary who does not know the defense); (ii) second paper describes various attacks assuming adversaries know what the defense is (which they called “adaptive”); and (iii) third paper then proposed robust defenses against such “adaptive” attacks. All of this bloat can be reduced to a single strong paper where proposing defenses should by default account for strongest possible attacks. This problem probably stems from the lack of proper system security background of ML researchers. Hence, learn the right way to apply security and privacy for ML systems. “Adversarial Attacks”: Such terms are tautological or redundant expressions in English. All attacks by definition are adversarial and there are no benign attacks. ML community started using them to indicate adversarial examples and then it became a mess. Do not make such mistakes just because the entire community has blindly decided to follow some convention. Overloading Terminology: New papers propose new terminology for things which are already exisiting in literature, bloating the set of terminology and adding to the confusion. For instance, Anthropic’s ue of alignment faking, deception, interal subversion etc. seems to refer to the same thing but ends up creating confusion and bloats the literature with different terms. There is no clear consensus in terminology currently. Try to avoid that and use consistent terms across your papers, within the ML community, but also across different communities. 2.5 How to Approach Projects Comparison with Baselines: Related Work: Conduct a thorough review before starting the project. Use related work to understand how to position your contribution. If similar work exists, determine whether your differentiation is clear, significant, worth the effort and suitable for publication Covering all relevant prior work is both ethical and essential for sound evaluation. Choosing Baselines: Given large number of baselines, you can reduce the scope by ranking them based on: state of the Art (SOTA) (demonstrated superiority over prior methods), publication venue (published in top-tier venues), and code availability (public or obtainable implementations). Ideally, baselines included for evaluation should satisfy all three. You may select the top X baselines using these criteria, but In all cases, clearly justify why certain baselines were included, and why others were excluded. Consider these additional cases to decide which baselines to include when all the three requirements (SOTA, publication, code availability) are met: If one prior baseline clearly demonstrates that it outperforms others in the same setting, weaker methods may be excluded. If baselines operate in different settings (e.g., client-side vs. server-side FL defenses), include all relevant variants. If prior works do not show consistent or significant improvements against competing baselines across different models or datasets, then include all of them in your evaluation for a fair comparison. For recent work or methods which were not compared with others whose relative performance with other baselines is unclear, include them for evaluation. Comparing against weakened baselines undermines credibility and invites criticism. Hence, when implementing baselines, consider the following: Always use official implementations and original configurations reported by prior work. If code is not public, reach out to the authors to politely ask if they can share their code or make it public (responses are not guaranteed). You can keep the mail very general highligting that you are interested in building on their work without explicit details of your project. Always give baselines an advantage: When claiming that your proposed approach outperforms prior work, make sure you have optimized the baselines using their best-reported configurations, and evaluate against the strongest possible version of prior work. This prevents misleading conclusions and incorrect claims. Reimplement prior work only when absolutely necessary. During reproduction, bugs or configuration mismatches can falsely suggest that your proposed approach is better than prior work. Hence, we want to avoid this. Experimental Hygiene Run each experiment multiple times per configuration. Report mean and standard deviation. Claim improvements only when differences are statistically significant. Use appropriate tests (e.g., t-test) or verify that confidence intervals do not overlap. Bugs and Sanity Checks: Perform regular sanity checks throughout implementation by checking if the results match with your expectations. Verify intermediate results at each step. If results deviate from expectations, investigate immediately. Spend time ensuring that results, reasoning, and narrative align. Models and Datasets: When comparing to prior work, use the same models, datasets, and configurations. This gives prior work an advantage and makes comparisons fair and credible. For broader evaluation, follow recent literature and test across diverse models. For model evaluation, reviewers expect coverage across scales, for example: small: ~7B parameters, medium: ~13B parameters, and large: ~70B parameters. This helps demonstrate robustness across model capacities and complexity of dataset. Integrity and Transparency: Maintain integrity in evaluation and reporting. If results are weak, revisit assumptions and redesign your approach or identify reasons why this is dunamentally difficult. Do not hide poor results.It is acceptable if your method fails in some cases. Understanding and reporting failure modes strengthens the paper. If so, come up with explainations why. Every claim should be backed by at least one of the following: citation to prior work, logical explanation (possibly grounded in prior work), and empirical evidence to validate your claim. "],["guidelines-implementations-and-code.html", "3 Guidelines: Implementations and Code", " 3 Guidelines: Implementations and Code "],["guidelines-writing-style-for-systems-security-papers.html", "4 Guidelines: Writing Style for Systems Security Papers 4.1 Post-publication Prcoess", " 4 Guidelines: Writing Style for Systems Security Papers Through my various research collaborations, my writing style has been influenced by different mentors. Some of these styles were conflicting, requiring me to adapt. But my current the writing style that I use has been heavily inspired by my advisor Prof. N Asokan, who was extremely patient while I made terrible writing mistakes. While there is still a long way to improve my writing, over time, I got a sense of how to write papers as expected by my advisor. The reason I rely and advocate this heavily is that (a) this is well-structure, systematic and easy to follow, and (b) responses from reviewers about writing have been mostly positive (including in some cases praises for combining a lot of context well as in our SoK paper which won the distinguished paper award at Oakland). In this blog post, I want to document the writing style in our group which I hope will be useful for others. Also, I will give concrete examples from existing papers to illustrate some aspects. For all the papers I have written after joining SSG, we have followed a more or less fixed template. You can see the pattern across the different papers clearly: paper1, paper2, … I found this standard template to be very systematic and easy to following. And generally, any new project which fits most of the themes (designing a new ML system (e.g., Laminator) or designing a new defense (e.g., grove, espresso), I can blindly follow the same template and get some decent systematic structure for the paper which is easy to follow. I want to discuss these below. Note that there are definetely variants of the template or cases where the template did not fit well (e.g., SoK does not have a problem statement) but they are usually within some reasonably minimal deviations from template. I also include a lot of my personaly style preferences for paper writing and this blog leans on that at several points. Structure We use overleaf and for all any new project, I include the following files as part of the basic template (naming is numbered so that it is easy to see since it is ordered according to the sections): 0macros.tex: contains all the macros 0abstract.tex: Indicates the text for abstract 1introduction.tex 2background.tex 3problem.tex 4approach.tex 5setup.tex: experimental setup: datasets, models, metrics, baselines (which could be described in background section but here we only highlight what is it we compare with) 6evaluation.tex: results and showing how your design meets all the described requirements laid out in 3problem.tex 7discussion.tex Writing: Start with the structure of the paper Then include the possible sections to include and add topic sentences for each Create a macro within which we indicate a high level description of what should be included. Then start writing the text and later switch off the macro. Note: In case of limited space, you can consider using the symbol § to replace “section”. 0macros.tex: Macros I mention some standard libraries and function calls I used for most papers which is useful and can be copied for all subsequent projects. gratutous use of synonyms: when using a word, always think if this will confuse the reader; technical words should be fixed; no synonyms; general english terms are ok 0abstract.tex: Abstract One line each: a general statement of the issue to be solved. why is it important and challenging a sentence motivating your goal of this work: “Hence, we need a defense which protects against…” Indicate the desiderate or requirements for an ideal system: Ideally, a defense should be… Limitations of prior work: Could be a simple statement like “None of the prior works meet all requirements” [No need to go into details in teh abstract; we will add more context in intro and further more in problem statement] All the above can be in one paragraph. Now we switch contexts, and indicate our contributions. Present our framework, and text to indicate what is unique with it (the first framework which is robust” the general ideal on why it works and addressing the challenges faces by prior works results (including some numbers XX% aaccuracy on YY)…and indicating that it satisfiess all requirements. One paragraph or two paragraphs: Ideally, I try to keep it one paragraph. But sometimes the problem description adn limitations of prior work take up space. In which case, I spearate our contributions and its result summary in a second paragrpah. Both are fine. If it is getting too long, split into two paragraphs. 1introduction.tex: Introduction one paragraph for each: general introduction to the area, current problem, challenges to solve the problem, ideal way to solve the problem (specify the requirements/desiderata), limitations of existing work, and our idea/intuition and brief approach along with the contributions (in bullet points) Contributions (No need for a specific subheading called contributions.): In some papers, you will find very long contributions which span paragraphs explaining how they solve the problem. This makes it hard for people (like me) who sometimes want o skim the paper and get a sense of the approach and their results in a quick glance. This requires me to read more than I want to…hence, going more towards conciseness, the constributions should be always be specific with forward pointers to the sections (do not waste space with an extra paragrpah saying the outline of the paper….e.g., We will discuss blabla in Section A, blublu in section B, cluclu in Section C, …). As my advisor keeps saying, trat empty space like real estate. Make sure every word you put is worth it. Also, not many people tend to read them since by looking at the headings in the papers, you can get a sense of what it will include. You can do the following: We claim the following (main) contributions: we present 2background.tex: Background SHould include subsections covering topics described in the rest of the work. ANy that you are propsing should not be mentioned. Backgroun should only containing exisiting work. Not even statements like “In this work, we will evaluate,…” though it might be ok to say “we focus our evaluation (see Section~\\(\\ref{}\\)) on ABC variant of the defense/attack and hence only include a description of this. For more comprehensive survye, refer to ABC et al.. Introduction to ML notations/LLM notations Other related desc 3problem.tex: Problem Statement Do not repeat text from instroduction or background. Start with what your objective is, not what the challenge or problem that you are solving is. “Our goal is to design a defense against prompt injection attacks.” The reader have gone over abstract, intro, and background, knows you are deadling with the problem of prompt injection and hence, the problem statement you can start iwht is you objective in this paper. Since we follow systems based work, the above statement generally follows with a set of requirement that an ideal system or defense should satisfy. Style Statement: Generally, problem statement can be small and may not require subsection. See my note on subsection in Misc towards the end. If the subsections are small, consider using to highlight the subheading. You might have the following subheading under problem statement: Threat Model/Adversary Description/Adversary Model System Model Requirements/Desiderata Limitations of Prior works (in light of the requirements) Challenges (set of challenges for building a system that you want to address in order to satisfy a requirement) Threat Model/Adversary Description/Adversary Model This should include assuptions about the adversary. See our SoK on various characteristics of an adversary to include as part of the threat model []. System Model This includes a description of the system, the pipeline or setting in which teh ML model is being used. In some cases, you can have a defender, or model builder, or prover, with their own set of assumptions. We can include their, goals, assumptions, access, knowledge (similar to adversary description) for describing the defender. Requirements/Desiderata Requirements are more strict and should be satified ideally; Desiderate is more like a general guidelines that should be followed.. This can be done to systematically indicate bullet points for challenges or limitations as well. For a lot of these, I generally use some latex enumerate type libraries to identify multiple requirements, challenges, which helps me refer to them later in the paper. For instance, for different requirements: We can then indicate by saying \\(\\ref{req1}\\) to refer to requirement 1. This list can be the same as what you have in the abstract and introduction. This is one of the rare things which are repeated in the text but problem statement is also the last time we will describe this. In case of space limitations, you can use This will put it in a single line and may require in the macros. Here are some example requirements I have used in prior work: effective (to reduce the attack success rate) efficient (incurs a low overhead) applicable/general (can be used for differrent cases without modification) Non-invasive (does not require making any changes) extensible (allows including more risks, parameters, etc.) robust (resist evasion by adversaries) utility-preserving (maintains acceptable utility on non-adversarial data) Scalable (supports large numbers of provers/verifiers). Versatile (supports a wide variety of properties; requires minimal effort to add support for new properties). Rest of the paper, should following the requirements. In toerhh words, the approach and evaluation section, shoudl constatly keep referring to how your design choices help satisfy some requirement or explicitly have subsections to either indicate the design choice to satisfy the requirement or to evaluate the system for a particular requirement. Note that some of the requirements may be a discussion rather than empirical evaluation (see non-invasive and general requirements for combining exisiting defenses; or scalable or versatile properties in laminator. Limitation of Prior work Firstly, a thourough coverage of related work is important. Further subscribe to arxiv daily digest and go voer them whenever the mail comes religiously. This helps to identify related works and even interesting unrelated works which could be future projects. I have had many such cases where I remember seeing a paper from the igest which turned out to be a related work for a new project. Systematically cover all the different papers and describe them; Since you have identified a set of requirements for an ideal system. (e.g., defense, framework), this helps to evaluate others with respect to those requirements. Have a table sumarizing how different papers satisfy different works. You can use checkmark or full circle for requirements being satisfied, or cross or empty circle for not satisfies (see wasysm or pifont libraries). Alternatively, partially sastified requirement can also be used but it has to be justified well….what counts as being partially satified? To decide whether or not empirically evaluate them, consider the following: if it is a SOTA for a given requirement, definitely use it for comparison any other non-SOTA can be ignore by citing the SOTA only if the SOTA has indicated an explicit comparison with other snad shown that they outperform them If there are papers which are not evaluated by SOTA, you might have to add that benchmark. If for most requirement, a defense does not satify, you can discount them saying they do not meet the requirements. But check if they are SOTA in any specific requiremtn and may need a comparison as indicated in the first point. This discussion should go into the problem statement under “limitations of prior work” but the description of all related works that will be compared in the problem statement should be in the background section. Challenges Include this if there are specific unique challenges that arise while trying to design an ideal system which satisifes all the requirements. We identify the folllowing challenges prior to deisngin such a defense: Challenge 1: Challenge 2: The ideal of labelling them is that in approach and evaluation, you can refer to these challenges and say how your design choices address these challenges \\(\\ref{c1}\\) to meet some requirement \\(\\ref{req}\\). These could include muplt challenges you may have to overcome while trying to meet a paritcular requirement. Tables I used to use normal table etc. But I came across booktabspackage which can give.very profession looking tables. Here are some general styles I follow: Booktabs examples multicol and multirow (texblog) Figures I have been very particular about the quality of the figures primary is using tikz: very classy figures and high quality with high precision of detail; No problem of font sizes and pixel degradation. Cons: requires a lot of time and effort. For me, I spend time making the figure as a hobby while watching some shows in the background. So this does not feel taxing. Some tikz files I have used and can help as boiler plate code for future projects: power point or keynote: Figures using these have turned out somewhat good in the past specially when there is a lot of things to include in the figure and tikz is a lot of work. For instance, espresso figure was done using powerpoint. However, I really liked comic sans font used in some figures for LLM papers and found it in keynote for mac. The SoK on threat model has a figure which was designed using keynote. Switching between templates Switch for arxiv and actual submission paper % % After submission, the space might be a limiting factor. Hence, some experiments can be included in teh arxiv version of the paper and the submission version can point to it: “ ” For different templates….I simply have a separate header file for a specific conference… 0acm.tex 0usenix.tex 0ndss.tex 0ieee.tex I make the title as a macro as well so I can only change the title in the macros and it is reflected across all versions Misc Active Voice: We always use active voice and this helps to specify who did a particular task. ABC task was evaluate in this process. (by whom? this is generally lost in passitve) Prior works or CDF et al.~ evaluated ABC task in this process. Exford Commas: Always use oxford commas [read up on it for more details]…if there are multiple items, A, B, C and D. oxford commas: A, B, C, and D. This also allows for simmilar items to be clubbed together, A, B and E, C and D. Here, we know B anE are linked but different from other items. Same works with “or”. Symbols: Use macros wherever possible. If you are using some term multiple times or acrosnym, consider having a macro for them. I cannot stress this enough. This saves a lot of time to go over different things and replacing them which could intrdouce errors. Some other things: When replacing with a macro check for the text. Previously the text could read “the adversary can evade”. Simple cntr+f adversary and replace with macro Adv will read incorrect: “the Adv can evade”. It is like saying “The donald trump” or “the Vasisht”. Extra check when replacing with macros that preceding “the” and “a” are accounted. Repeating Text: Ideally we don’t repeat text from previous section. Once we have defined or explained something, we can simply refer to that text later if needed. In some cases, it has been a while and the reader is likely to forget the context. You can use “Recall from Section~\\(\\ref{}\\) where we discussed…” If a section has less or equal to two subsections which are relattively smal, consider not having them as subsections. You can differentiate text and create subheadings using , , and a combination of them. What I follow is this: : this acts as the heading (previosuly the subsection heading) : : : : blabla bla This makes it clear that H1 is the bigger heading under which you have three subcategories or topics. is again my styling choice. it makes the heading start without any indent which looks cleaner and separates it from other paragraphs. Using LLMs: My writing has improved in terms of less errors (grammar, spellings etc) after using LLMs. I have found LLMs can be useful when I have a garbled sentence but need to make ti more clear and precisie. Hence, asking it to improve text and making it concise generally does a decent job. However, using LLMs for entire paragraphs and sections is too much specially that I have to go voer the output to make sure the model did not generate some incorrect stuff. This is time consuming. So i tend to use it for limited cases for some specific sentences. Check for Logical Consistency among Statements For every subsequent statement, make it it flows well wrt to the previous one. If there is any abrupt changes or awkward reading, that is a sign to consider removing, rephrasing or adding more context to make the flow better. This is a constant check that has to be done for every statement you write. Backup Every Statement This is very important. Never make statements that you cannot verify or backup. It is empty statements and mean nothing. There are three ways to do it (should be considered in order when you are trying to back up your statements): refer to prior works (citation to say that you statement was verifier by some other works empirically) logically argue (there could be cases where some deductions can be straightforward and do not need an evlauation; for instance, their appropach uses fine-tning over ABC and DEF requiring XYZ GPUs and hence, inefficient for practical use). Empirically backing up: If none of the above work, you have to resort to setting up an experiment and evaluating it. For instance, in our SoK, we made a statement that “overfitting and memorization can occur together or indepdently” While there was some citations previously, there was nothing concrete to verify the different cases. So, we had a small experiment (separate from that in the main paper) to validate this. Note that this had some connection to the discussion at hand since overfitting and memorization were critical to the paper, and we had space. If your statement is not critically important and /or limited space, you can resort to the results in teh appendix and state in the main body “we conduct a small experiments to verufy this which is discussed in Appendix A”. Consistency Never use synonyms for any technical terms. If you have defined a term in the beginning, make sure the rest of the paper also uses it. Synonyms while improves general english writing is likely to confuse readers in technical writing. So ensure the same terms are consistently used everywhere. References Citations should be towards the end of the sentence only if being referred as a number. This was done in prior work~. If it is a name of a system, you can use Name~, was proposed as a defense against… In case there is a list, citations should come with the relevant items. Their approach was ineffective~, ineffeicient~, and easy to evade~. In case, you have your own evaluation pointing to some result in addition to citation, you can do the following: “Their approach was ineffective~, ineffeicient~, and easy to evade (~ and Section~\\(\\ref{}\\)).” to indicate there was some prior work suggesting this but you also show it in your evaluation (maybe in a different context with some novelty; otherwise there is no need for evaluation and you can simply cite prior work) In the paper, always use ABC et al~ or 4.1 Post-publication Prcoess Work on the code and make it publicly available on the group’s github page. Make one single clean push with a new repo so no commit history is visible. See XX on guidelines to write code. Push the camera ready version on arxiv with an indication of where it is published in comments. Work on a short blog (if required) highlighting the problem, key results, and main takeaway. Update the website with the new publication in the correct format and all the appropriate links (including to the blog post). Make a post for X and LinkedIN using the official group handles (and not personal handles) sharing the work. You can use the following template: Our paper titled &quot;XX&quot; has been accepted to &quot;YY&quot; **Authors**: X, Y, Z **Problem**: &lt;one line description&gt; Approach: &lt;one line description&gt; Results + Takeaways: &lt;one line description: We show that...This highliths the importance of...&gt; Start working on on the presentation (see XXX) and get feedback and finalize it. We make a master’s slide deck which is a long form presentation covering all parts of the paper. We then create a copy of the master deck to specific cases depending on the time limit as required. 4.1.1 Process Once you give me a draft of some sections or the paper…I will go over and leave comments and make changes…Ideally, I will do this online with you so you can see how to make the changes and write the papers in the hope that you will pick it up and can do it independently in the future with minimal supervision. These would be long meetings to go over the paper together but use these initial meetings as a teaching session to write papers well. Ideally, start by giving me the abstract and introduction. While many people prefer to write it at the end, writing this at the beginning gives an idea about how to position rest of the paper. Once we have finalized the storyline of the paper and agreed on common termiinplogy (do not use synonyms for technical words) you can update the rest of the text accordingly to rflect the introduction. Generally, once I make edits and sign off on the changes, do not overwrite them unless you run the changes by me and I can approve. otherwise, there might be additional inconsistencies or clarifications which are missed.

This allows me to combine slides from different projects for my presentations. Citations on each slides of the style: ABC et al. . Venue. year. Also make the paper as a link. You can consider variations but make sure it is constent throughtout the slides. Last slide should say summary with a QR code linking to the paper No “thank you” or “Questions”…waste of space… Similar format as the paper…… use the real estate for title slide to convey a message; iNstead of saying introduction say “AI regulations are emerging” What is the problem Color coding: See if each slide there is something to color code BLue: important Red: bad Green good Avoid orphans Not a big fan of lot of fancy animatiions and icons…keep it simple…at most consider text boxes etc. "]]
