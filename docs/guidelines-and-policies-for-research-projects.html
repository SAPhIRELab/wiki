<p><strong>Undergraduates:</strong>
Undergraduates can select a project to worn on with master’s or PhD students, typically helping with implementation and experimentation. The goal is to provide early exposure to research and prepare you for potential graduate studies.</p>
<p><strong>Master’s Students:</strong>
Master’s students are usually paired with a PhD student on an existing project to learn: how projects evolve, and our group’s working style.</p>
<p>You may also propose your own project, provided it meets the criteria for a good research project (note: a “good project” is not the same as a top-tier paper). Independent projects are allowed if you are confident about completing them successfully. Run your ideas by Vasisht (and get feedback from other members of the group) before continuing with the project.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations for PhD Students:</strong> PhD students are expected to lead <strong>at least three to four projects</strong> during their PhD and serve as <strong>first author</strong> on these projects.
You may collaborate with master’s or undergraduate students, but your contributions must be clearly distinguishable and substantial (covering implementation; writing and leadership).</p>
<p><strong>Mentorship by Senior PhD Students (4th year):</strong> Senior PhD students are expected to mentor junior students by (a) proposing ideas suitable for undergraduate or master’s theses, and (b) guiding project execution, experimental rigor, and implementation quality.</p>
<p>It is encouraged to have two or so <strong>non–first-authored papers</strong> where you acted as a mentor and project lead. Such projects may also be included in your thesis, especially if you proposed the idea. You claim mentorship experience of junior students this way.</p>
<p><strong>Project Load:</strong> For each master’s and Ph.D. students should typically work on <strong>around two projects at a time</strong>. This allows you to continue making progress if one project temporarily hits a roadblock.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Teamwork:</strong> Since our work is heavily empirical, I strongly encourage students to <em>work in pairs</em>. This helps with: (a) learning from each other, (b) catching bugs through cross-checking, (c) brainstorming when stuck, (d) reducing individual overhead, and (e) managing empirically heavy workloads.</p>
<p>However, tasks must be <em>clearly differentiated</em>. This is essential for statements of contribution in theses, and dair and transparent credit allocation. Be explicit and upfront about who is responsible for what.</p>
<p><strong>Authorship Guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>First Author</em>: Leads the project, does most of the implementation and writing, and may have proposed or refined the idea.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Second Author:</em> Contributes significant implementation and writing, supporting the first author.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Subsequent Authors:</em> Provide high-level supervision and guidance (e.g., faculty, postdocs).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Equal authorship is acceptable, but the <strong>division of work must be clearly documented</strong>, especially for thesis reporting.</p>
<div id="research-project-list" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Research Project List<a href="guidelines-and-policies-for-research-projects.html#research-project-list" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A list of potential research projects is maintained in an internal Google document.<br />
This document is <strong>confidential</strong> and must not be shared externally.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Respect intellectual property.</p></li>
<li><p>Work with the original proposers and give appropriate credit.</p></li>
<li><p>If interested in a topic, contact the listed mentor (me and/or the students who proposed an idea mentioned in the document).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposing New Ideas:</strong> Before adding a new idea, discuss it with me and others in the lab to identify gaps and refine it. This process is intentionally adversarial (acting as devil’s advocate to try and identify gaps) to filter weak ideas and identify promising ones.
Once project seems reasonable, add it to the project list to gauge interest from other members of the group. If multiple students are interested: you may lead the project and assign tasks, and/or act as a mentor and let junior students execute the work (assuming it is not o primary interest to you). I also recommend maintaining a personal idea list and revisiting it periodically.</p>

<div id="ok-paper-vs.-good-paper" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Ok paper vs. Good Paper<a href="guidelines-and-policies-for-research-projects.html#ok-paper-vs.-good-paper" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>This is my personal opinion on what type of prjects are interesting. You can work on different types of projects:
Good papers have an interesting takeaway either pushing back on what has been shared previously or highligting the limitations of exisiting work, or presenting a new approach forward setting up guidelines for a certain line of research. Such papers are useful and have a teachable aspect.</p>
<ul>
<li>Attack Papers: low hanging fruits with good chance of several people working on it. This makes it very competitive requiring the work to outperfrom all baselines along with putting the paper out first before you get scooped. There is a high risk of getting scooped and the overall takeaway is not signficant.
For instance, while designing attacks for novel models, it is important to be careful. This could be interesting if the attck being proposed has not been considered. For instance, propsing a new threat model which is practical is generally good. However, careful of taking exisiting attacks and adapting them to new model types or settings. For instance, ML models are susceptible to various risks: membership inference, attribute inference, etc. And there are novel models being proposed covering: classifiers, vision language models, large language models, etc. All possible combinations of risks in set 1 with model types in set 2 can be a possible paper. However, these are low hanging fruits and unless the paper shows that the design of attack is not trivial and outperforms prior work and breaks all exisiting defenses, the work is likely to be weak and not interesting.
Also, personally, these works do not excite me…the takeaway that I can perform attack X and model type Y is not interesting. There is some novelty but the overall takeaway is not suprising.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should be differentiated from the work which proposes a new adversary model to evaluate and presents the first attack in that threat model. Those can be very interesting specially..
You can also propose attack papers which break all prior defenses systematically highlighting the limitations of prior work (as done by Carlini et al.).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Defense Papers: Designing a good defense is very hard. Think about who the adversary is, assume that they have full knowledge about how the defense works, and then see the kind of attacks they can perform. See how Carlini designs and breaks exisiting defenses. Make sure when you design defenses, you can confidently publish the defense where it does not get broken in an emabrrisinng way. Account for all possible attacks, and then think of how to design defenses.
Sometimgs, it is ok to have a defense not being effective. Highlight under what conditions is the defense effective and where the defense fails..be transparent about it and see if you can argue why the conditions where defense is effective matters and useful while adding a discussion on how to address the failure cases (utility drop too much etc.). For instance, [Nils paper] or [grove] where the defenses are not perfect but can be addressed.</p></li>
<li><p>SoK: Systematization of prior work…THIS IS NOT A SURVEY PAPER. And this is a lot of work to write a good SoK. Not only do you have to read a lot papers but you have to try and find …
There are several SoK, which cateogrize papers into different themes making it easier to understand. You can find several papers such as. … These are accepted in top tier venues. However, to write an SoK with me, I expect the paper to have some interesting insights on perspective which is not categorization. It can be an actionable guideline which you can evaluate against prior work, or building a systematic framework of underlying causes using which you explain all prior work, can predict new ones, and …This means the paper will have some proposed guideline/algorithm/conjecture which needs to be validated either using the survey from prior work or empirically. Those papers tend to teach something.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="what-is-expected-of-the-projects" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> What is expected of the projects<a href="guidelines-and-policies-for-research-projects.html#what-is-expected-of-the-projects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Experimental hygienece: Each run should be done multiple times with a given configuration and should report mean and standard deviation; you should indicate whether some numbers are higher or lower only if they are statistically signficant differences (you can use some tests like t-test to verify this on more simply by seeing if the mean +- standard deviation lies outside the mean and standard deviation of the second value being compared with).</p>
<p>Implementsion: For prior works as baselines, always try to use their implementation. If their implementation is not publicly available, reach out to them to see if they can share their code (they might not respond). Only in the setting where it is absolutely necessary, you should repdocue other works. The reason is that during reproductio, you may introduce bugs or the configuration might be different resulting in a false sense of improvement over prior works. ALWAYS give baselines an advantage (either in terms of configuration or implementations.) basically you want to evaluate against the strongest possible configuration where their approach is the best performing. This avoids the problem</p>
<p>Related work: Always do a thourough review of releated work before starting the project. This gives an idea of how to position your work relative to them and also…It is ok if there are similar projects to yours, in which case, you should think of how you can differentiate your work from them and if that addition is signficant enough for a publication and your effort. This is also ethical to cover all related work in the paper and cite them but also ensured that you accounted for all prior works.</p>
<p>baselines (how to decide which baselines to include): If there are prior works which outperform all others, that can be included and all the poorly performing works can be ignored since the paper already shows others are not effective. This is when the proposed approach is signficantly better in all cases and are in the saem setting. However, if the setting is different (e.g., one defense works on clients in FL but the other applies for server in FL) then all variants should be included. Also, if the improvement is not signficant in all cases, both papers have to be compared with. finally, many times due to concurrant papers, some prior works are not evaluated or compared with more recent works. Since the relative perfroamcne is not clear, you should evaluate against all of them.
In all cases, you should be able to justify your choice of baselines for comparison for both: why you included some and why you excluded some.</p>
<p>Always make sure that prior work baselines have the same configuration using which they reported their results in the paper. You want to compare your work with the strongest baselines and not a watered down version. There are downstream implications of not doing so: others may find issues with your approach showing it is not effective which undermines your work.</p>
<p>Among lot of prior works, you can select the ones to evaluate by ranking them according to:
- SOTA (are they SOTA and show that they outperform across prior works)
- publication (are they published in top tier venues; if paper is on arxiv or low tiered venues, it is ok to skip)
- Code (are the code publicly available or something that can be obtained).
Ideally, all three should be met and those papers can be considered as good baselines.
You can filter out the papers by selecting the top X for evaluation based on the above. But make sure you thoroughly justify your reason without any gaps for push backs.</p>
<p>Bugs: Try to make sure your implementations are accurate and do regular sanity checks. Check the results in each step and see if it makes sense. If the numbers deviate from your expected values, try to identify the reaons why. Implementations (specially with all GenAI tools and publicly available codes) are easier than they used to be….So spend more time in making sure your storyline and results are correct.</p>
<p>Finally, needless to say, ensure integrity in your evaluation and result reporting. If there are some errors and bugs, fix them. If the results are bad, go back to the drawing board and figure out what is wrong. Also, while reporting results, you may find that your approach works for 9 cases but not for the remaining 1 case. That is ok. Spend time in identifying why something does not work and indicate them in the paper.</p>
<p>Three ways to back up your results or conjectures on why something deviates:
- citing prior works
- giving logical explanation for something (can include based on prior work)
- empirically evaluating to back up your conjecture.
The above are also applicable for each statement and claims you make in the paper. Check for each sentence to see if they are backed up sufficiently to avoid push backs.</p>
<p>Decide models/dataset to evaluate against: When comparing with prior works, make sure you use the same models, dataset, and configuration as prior works and compare your work in their setting. This gives them an advantage and your results are more reliable if demonstrating that your approach is better than prior works. For general evaluation, for models, you can take models and datasets used in recent prior works and compare against them. For models, reviewers expect evaluation across different sizes, capacities etc. (keeping in mind LLMs). You can consider two models of each small (7B), medium (13B), and large (70B) for evaluation.</p>
