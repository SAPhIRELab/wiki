<p><strong>Undergraduates:</strong>
Undergraduates can select a project to worn on with master’s or PhD students, typically helping with implementation and experimentation. The goal is to provide early exposure to research and prepare you for potential graduate studies.</p>
<p><strong>Master’s Students:</strong>
Master’s students are usually paired with a PhD student on an existing project to learn: how projects evolve, and our group’s working style.</p>
<p>You may also propose your own project, provided it meets the criteria for a good research project (note: a “good project” is not the same as a top-tier paper). Independent projects are allowed if you are confident about completing them successfully. Run your ideas by Vasisht (and get feedback from other members of the group) before continuing with the project.</p>
<p><strong>Expectations for PhD Students:</strong> PhD students are expected to lead around <em>three to four projects</em> during their PhD and serve as <em>first author</em> on these projects.
You may collaborate with master’s or undergraduate students, but your contributions must be clearly distinguishable and substantial (covering implementation; writing and leadership).</p>
<p><strong>Mentorship by Senior PhD Students (4th year):</strong> Senior PhD students are expected to mentor junior students by (a) proposing ideas suitable for undergraduate or master’s theses, and (b) guiding project execution, experimental rigor, and implementation quality.</p>
<p>It is encouraged to have two or so <em>non–first-authored papers</em> where you acted as a mentor and project lead. Such projects may also be included in your thesis, especially if you proposed the idea. You claim mentorship experience of junior students this way.</p>
<p><strong>Project Load:</strong> For each master’s and Ph.D. students should typically work on <em>around two projects at a time</em>. This allows you to continue making progress if one project temporarily hits a roadblock.</p>
<p><strong>Collaboration and Teamwork:</strong> Since our work is heavily empirical, I strongly encourage students to <em>work in pairs</em>. This helps with: (a) learning from each other, (b) catching bugs through cross-checking, (c) brainstorming when stuck, (d) reducing individual overhead, and (e) managing empirically heavy workloads.</p>
<p>However, tasks must be <em>clearly differentiated</em>. This is essential for statements of contribution in theses, and dair and transparent credit allocation. Be explicit and upfront about who is responsible for what.</p>
<p><strong>Authorship Guidelines:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>First Author</em>: Leads the project, does most of the implementation and writing, and may have proposed or refined the idea.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Second Author:</em> Contributes significant implementation and writing, supporting the first author.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Subsequent Authors:</em> Provide high-level supervision and guidance (e.g., faculty, postdocs).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Equal authorship is acceptable, but the <strong>division of work must be clearly documented</strong>, especially for thesis reporting.</p>
<div id="list-of-research-projects" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> List of Research Projects<a href="guidelines-research-projects.html#list-of-research-projects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A list of potential research projects is maintained in an internal <a href="">Google document</a>.<br />
This document is <strong>confidential</strong> and must not be shared externally. Respect intellectual property, and work with the original proposers and give appropriate credit. If interested in a topic, contact the listed mentor (me and/or the students who proposed an idea mentioned in the document).</p>
<p><strong>Proposing New Ideas:</strong> Before adding a new idea, discuss it with me and others in the lab to identify gaps and refine it. This process is intentionally adversarial (acting as devil’s advocate to try and identify gaps) to filter weak ideas and identify promising ones.
Once project seems reasonable, add it to the project list to gauge interest from other members of the group. If multiple students are interested: you may lead the project and assign tasks, and/or act as a mentor and let junior students execute the work (assuming it is not o primary interest to you). I also recommend maintaining a personal idea list and revisiting it periodically.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Types of Projects<a href="guidelines-research-projects.html#types-of-projects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>This is inherently hard—there is no fixed formula for a good paper.<br />
I particularly enjoy projects that offer a clear and compelling takeaway. These include work that challenges widely accepted assumptions, highlights fundamental limitations of existing approaches, or proposes new, principled directions or guidelines for a research area. I also value projects that are experimentally rigorous, providing comprehensive evaluations that cover all relevant baselines and corner cases.
Answering “why” does some unintended behavior happens is harder but more rewarding compared to “how” to do something (e.g., showing attacks work). Always strive to include a discussion on why along with how to strenghten the paper regalrdless of type pf project indicated below.</p>
<p><strong>Libraries and Benchmarks:</strong> Designing open-source libraries or frameworks for real-world use and industry adoption is valuable. However, it requires significant time and maintenance effort, and adoption by researchers or practitioners is uncertain and difficult to predict.
Pursue this path only with clear motivation and long-term commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Attack Papers:</strong> Attack papers can be attractive but come with important caveats: many are low-hanging fruit, leading to high competition and high risk of being scooped. Simply adapting existing attacks to new model classes or threat types is usually weak unless the attack is non-trivial, substantially outperforms prior work, and breaks existing defenses in a meaningful way. Personally, papers that show “known attack X works can be adapted to new model type Y” are not very exciting even if they can be published in top-tier venues (with extensive empirical evaluation) <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3460120.3484770">1</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/zhang-zhikun">2</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00968">3</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3460120.3484571">4</a>, <a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Sha_Cant_Steal_Cont-Steal_Contrastive_Stealing_Attacks_Against_Image_Encoders_CVPR_2023_paper.html">5</a>. I would identify such papers as low hanging fruits which are ok as projects for master’s students but I suggest Ph.D students to take up more interesting research directions.</p>
<p>As an exception to the above discussion, works that proposes a new, practical threat models and presents the <em>first</em> attack in a <em>practical setting or real-world systems</em> can be very interesting (see papers by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=rejZUEkAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate">Vitaly Shmatikov</a> as an example); or highlighting issues and provide insights with exisiting work <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/satml/2025/171100a385/26VnnZGainS">1</a>. Similarly, papers that systematically break prior defenses and expose systematic limitations in prior work (e.g., Carlini-style work: <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=7B9mTg7z25">1</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/athalye18a.html">2</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3128572.3140444">3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14851">4</a>) are good contributions, as they highlight systematic issues with approaches in the community and provide guidelines to address them.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Papers:</strong> Designing strong defenses is extremely difficult.Despite empirical evaluation showing that a defense is effective, it is important to check whether the protection is due to the defense design or an artifact of improper attack setup: <a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/91ffdc5e2f12436d99914418e38d0a09-Abstract-Conference.html">1</a> and <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2024/yet-another-broken-defense.html">2</a>. It is very important to design strong attacks in order to demonstrate effectiveness of defenses. This includes that the hyperparameter tuning for the attacks to improve attack effectiveness. This is the reason several papers on robustness have been broken<a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=7B9mTg7z25">1</a>, <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/athalye18a.html">2</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3128572.3140444">3</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14851">4</a>).</p>
<p>When proposing a defense: assume a fully informed adversary, and consider all realistic attack strategies, including assuming that the adversary can design attacks specific to the defense (aka “adaptive attack” though that use is incorrect). Also, important to stress-test the defense thoroughly against all attacks tuned to ensure perfect attack success.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is acceptable for a defense to be imperfect where the you clearly state when it works and when it fails, you justify why the effective regime matters, and discuss limitations and future directions to address the limitations transparently. For instance, see the paper on fingerprinting using conferrable examples which is not effective with adversarial training <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00888">1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Systems Papers:</strong> Laminator and Pal*M</p>
<p><strong>SoK (Systematization of Knowledge):</strong> An SoK paper is not merely a survey, and doing it well is challenging—often harder than writing a standard attack or defense paper. While simple categorization (e.g., <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.04131">1</a>) can be useful and accepted at top venues, such works are closer to conventional surveys and are not what I aim to do.</p>
<p>I view a strong SoK as proposing a guideline, framework, or theory that explains how and why phenomena occur. This theory is necessarily a conjecture—imperfect but principled—that captures the majority of cases through underlying factors or principles, and enables reasoning about and prediction of future cases. The evaluation in an SoK should therefore justify why the conjecture is reasonable: by showing that it explains prior work and by empirically validating unexplored cases.</p>
<p>In other words, prior work should be used to validate your proposed theory or conjecture. Strong SoK papers articulate a unifying framework or conjecture and support it through systematic analysis and/or empirical evidence. Throughout, they should clearly identify who can use the framework, how it should be applied, and why it is useful. See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04542">1</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=C7FgsjfFRC">2</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Proposing a Novel Notion/Concept:</strong> Sometimes the paper is not necessarily ground breaking but introduces a new concept. For instance, my first work on “Attesting Distributional Properties of Training Data” is not a practical solution that is likely to be deployed. Hence, I downplay that work in presentations. But I use this to highlight limitations of such techniques such as those based and also the first paper to propose the notion of ML property attestation.
Similarly, there could be papers which you are proposing for the first time but do not have good solutions to solve it. I encourage you to write it up with tentative solutions or directions, and highlight the limitations and need for future work to address them. These can also be reframed as a position paper is sufficient positions are identified and defended.</p>
<p><strong>Position Papers:</strong> I have also dabbled with position papers when the community seemed to have deviated from some core principles. This can be good pieces of work. But generally, you should have expertise on some topic to identify that something is completely wrong and you can rant about it in a systematic and principled way (see <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=YmTxiR1HUX">1</a>, <a href="https://icml.cc/virtual/2024/poster/33114">2</a>). Hence, their occurances will be rather rare and will be explored only if there is substantial thing to say clearly highlighting the issues and presenting guidelines to address them, which cannot be covered in a tweet or a blogpost.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> My Approach to Identifying Research Problems<a href="guidelines-research-projects.html#my-approach-to-identifying-research-problems" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>I highlight my general approach to identify research problems. Note that this is not perfect and many times I get excited about some ideas but have to be discarded over more discussions and thinking as they are incremental and not very exciting as initially thought. I suggest have a scratchpad of ideas and spend time on verifying if they are reasonable by talking with others including me. Note that a lot of my ideas get discarded so don’t get discouraged by it.</p>
<p>The first step to identify new ideas is to read papers. There is not alternative to this. The more variety papers you read, the more ideas you get. for a specifi topic or if you want to break into a new topic, identify most important papers (recent SOTA papers from top tier venues), published SoKs, and track down other related works using the papers cited within them. Once you start going over them, you can see whether your idea holds with respect all those papers.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Naive Combinations:</em> Having read some papers on different problems, I try to see whether either their approaches can be used to solve problems in ML Security and privacy. This gave give an initial low hanging fruit ideas to explore after which additional discussions are required to show the challenges in using the concepts directly. <em>More challenges make a good paper once you solve them and shows that your work is not a trivial extension of prior work.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Inspired from Other Domains:</em> Papers inspired by topics already explored in other areas is often interesting to me. For instance, works which make parallels between systems security problems of data and control flow integrity with prompt injection attacks are the right way to this of this. Hence, working on papers which take inspiration from concepts in other fields (e.g., return oriented programming) and motivate their approach by describing parallels with other techniques can be interesting way to frame research problems.
Additionally, this can be across different domains: I often think about how problems in security and privacy can benefit from research in other fields such as programming languages, formal verification, human-computer interaction, etc. to explore what tools and techniques in other fields can address problems in the current field of research (ML security and privacy).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Systematic Work:</em> Even when prior work addresses a problem, it is often in isolation and limited to specific attacks or defenses. I am drawn to systematic research that comprehensively surveys related work, identifies recurring patterns and failure modes, and develops principled, general solutions that extend beyond the specific cases previously studied. Although this approach requires more effort, it yields a unified explanation of broad classes of phenomena rather than fragmented insights across many narrow papers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I prefer one strong, comprehensive paper built on a common underlying framework compared to multiple shorter papers that each study a single case or specific instantiation of the general problem. For example, while several works examine pairwise defense combinations or unintended interactions, my work systematically synthesizes prior results, exposes their limitations, and provides a unified explanation applicable across settings (see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04542">1</a> and <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=C7FgsjfFRC">2</a>).</p>
<p>Crucially, such frameworks answer the underlying “why”, enabling explanation and prediction of new interactions; subsequent case studies then primarily serve to empirically validate these predictions and are not suprising since they can be explained using your framework. In my experience, this style of work leads to deeper, more impactful contributions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Identify Problems Pertaining to Practical Deployment:</em> People often complain that research is not applicable for practical systems. And indeed a lot of papers being published consider academic problems (for instance, personally various privacy attacks such as distribution inference <a href=""></a> and membership inference <a href=""></a> seem of academic interests but not necessarily a concern for practitioners). Any opportunity you get, try to have conversations with people in the industry to see what problems they think are an issues</p></li>
<li><p>For all papers, try to identify a set of requirements which should be ideally met by the attacks, defenses, or other systems you are working on and show how the design meets all requirements but also evaluate against each of those requirements. See discussion on examples of different possible requirements in the chapter presenting guidelines on writing papers.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="careful-with-terminology" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Careful with Terminology<a href="guidelines-research-projects.html#careful-with-terminology" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>ML literature is riddled with bad terminology and please avoid them while writing papers:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Adaptive attacks”</em>: ML community uses adaptive attacks to indicate a setting where adversary knows about the defenses and designs attacks against them. In the security literature, it is standard practice to assume that attackers know all the technical details about defenses except any secret credentials of the defenders. We will use “adaptive” in the traditional systems security sense where adversary optimizes query based on loss of previous responses. Hence, we have the following convention: na"ive (no knowledge of defense), non-adaptive (optimizes attacks on another local surrogate model without feedback from target model), and adaptive (optimizes attack using feedback from the previous target model responses). Some evasion attacks and jailbreaks can be considered adaptive if they optimize their queries based on previous responses from target model.</li>
</ul>
<p>An implication of this incorrect use of terminology has resulted in publication of three set of papers: (i) first paper highlights a problem and proposes a “defense” assuming a simple adversary (aka naive adversary who does not know the defense); (ii) second paper describes various attacks assuming adversaries know what the defense is (which they called “adaptive”); and (iii) third paper then proposed robust defenses against such “adaptive” attacks.
All of this bloat can be reduced to a single strong paper where proposing defenses should by default account for strongest possible attacks.
This problem probably stems from the lack of proper system security background of ML researchers. Hence, learn the right way to apply security and privacy for ML systems.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>“Adversarial Attacks”</em>: Such terms are tautological or redundant expressions in English. All attacks by definition are adversarial and there are no benign attacks. ML community started using them to indicate adversarial examples and then it became a mess. Do not make such mistakes just because the entire community has blindly decided to follow some convention.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Overloading Terminology:</em> New papers propose new terminology for things which are already exisiting in literature, bloating the set of terminology and adding to the confusion. For instance, Anthropic’s ue of alignment faking, deception, interal subversion etc. seems to refer to the same thing but ends up creating confusion and bloats the literature with different terms. There is no clear consensus in terminology currently. Try to avoid that and use consistent terms across your papers, within the ML community, but also across different communities.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.5</span> How to Approach Projects<a href="guidelines-research-projects.html#how-to-approach-projects" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Comparison with Baselines:</strong></p>
<p><em>Related Work:</em> Conduct a thorough review <em>before starting</em> the project. Use related work to understand how to position your contribution. If similar work exists, determine whether your differentiation is clear, significant, worth the effort and suitable for publication
Covering all relevant prior work is both <em>ethical</em> and essential for sound evaluation.</p>
<p><em>Choosing Baselines:</em> Given large number of baselines, you can reduce the scope by ranking them based on: <em>state of the Art (SOTA)</em> (demonstrated superiority over prior methods), <em>publication venue</em> (published in top-tier venues), and <em>code availability</em> (public or obtainable implementations).
Ideally, baselines included for evaluation should satisfy all three.<br />
You may select the top <em>X</em> baselines using these criteria, but In all cases, clearly justify why certain baselines were included, and why others were excluded.
Consider these additional cases to decide which baselines to include when all the three requirements (SOTA, publication, code availability) are met:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If one prior baseline clearly demonstrates that it outperforms others in the <em>same setting</em>, weaker methods may be excluded.</p></li>
<li><p>If baselines operate in <strong>different settings</strong> (e.g., client-side vs. server-side FL defenses), include all relevant variants.</p></li>
<li><p>If prior works do not show consistent or significant improvements against competing baselines across different models or datasets, then include all of them in your evaluation for a fair comparison.</p></li>
<li><p>For recent work or methods which were not compared with others whose relative performance with other baselines is unclear, include them for evaluation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Comparing against weakened baselines undermines credibility and invites criticism. Hence, when implementing baselines, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always use <strong>official implementations</strong> and <strong>original configurations</strong> reported by prior work.</p></li>
<li><p>If code is not public, reach out to the authors to politely ask if they can share their code or make it public (responses are not guaranteed). You can keep the mail very general highligting that you are interested in building on their work without explicit details of your project.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Always give baselines an advantage:</em> When claiming that your proposed approach outperforms prior work, make sure you have optimized the baselines using their best-reported configurations, and evaluate against the strongest possible version of prior work. This prevents misleading conclusions and incorrect claims.</p></li>
<li><p>Reimplement prior work only when absolutely necessary. During reproduction, bugs or configuration mismatches can falsely suggest that your proposed approach is better than prior work. Hence, we want to avoid this.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Experimental Hygiene</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Run each experiment multiple times per configuration.</p></li>
<li><p>Report <strong>mean and standard deviation</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Claim improvements only when differences are <strong>statistically significant</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use appropriate tests (e.g., t-test) or verify that confidence intervals do not overlap.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Bugs and Sanity Checks:</strong> Perform regular sanity checks throughout implementation by checking if the results match with your expectations. Verify intermediate results at each step. If results deviate from expectations, investigate immediately. Spend time ensuring that <em>results, reasoning, and narrative align</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Models and Datasets:</strong> When comparing to prior work, use the <strong>same models, datasets, and configurations</strong>. This gives prior work an advantage and makes comparisons fair and credible. For broader evaluation, follow recent literature and test across diverse models. For model evaluation, reviewers expect coverage across scales, for example: small: ~7B parameters, medium: ~13B parameters, and large: ~70B parameters. This helps demonstrate robustness across model capacities and complexity of dataset.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity and Transparency:</strong> Maintain integrity in evaluation and reporting. If results are weak, revisit assumptions and redesign your approach or identify reasons why this is dunamentally difficult. Do not hide poor results.It is acceptable if your method fails in some cases. Understanding and reporting failure modes strengthens the paper. If so, come up with explainations why. Every claim should be backed by at least one of the following: citation to prior work, logical explanation (possibly grounded in prior work), and empirical evidence to validate your claim.</p>
