# Guidelines: Preparing Slides for Presentation

We have a standard template we use in our group, and for papers, we should follow the suggested template. This allows me to combine slides from different projects for my presentations.

Citations on each slides of the style:
ABC et al. <Paper name: italics>. Venue. year.
Also make the paper as a link. You can consider variations but make sure it is constent throughtout the slides.
Last slide should say summary with a QR code linking to the paper
No “thank you” or “Questions”…waste of space…
Similar format as the paper……
use the real estate for title slide to convey a message; iNstead of saying introduction say “AI regulations are emerging”
What is the problem
Color coding:
See if each slide there is something to color code
BLue: important
Red: bad
Green good
Avoid orphans

Not a big fan of lot of fancy animatiions and icons...keep it simple...at most consider text boxes etc.
